FFFFFFF,,"Displays the seven most significant digits of the seconds fraction: ten millionths of a second. However, trailing zeros, or seven zero digits, are not displayed."
gg,,The period or era. This pattern is ignored if the date to be formatted does not have an associated period or era string.
h,%h,"The hour in a 12-hour clock. Single-digit hours do not have a leading zero. If this format pattern is not combined with other format patterns, just ""h"" alone, then the application will throw an error."
hh,,The hour in a 12-hour clock. Single-digit hours have a leading zero. ➞ 02
H,%H,"The hour in a 24-hour clock. Single-digit hours do not have a leading zero. If this format pattern is not combined with other format patterns, just ""H"" alone, then the application will throw an error."
HH,,The hour in a 24-hour clock. Single-digit hours have a leading zero. ➞ 14

MMM,,The abbreviated name of the month ➞ Mar
MMMM,,The full name of the month ➞ March
s,%s,"The second. Single-digit seconds do not have a leading zero. ➞ 22. If this format pattern is not combined with other format patterns, just ""s"" alone, then the application will apply the standard SortableDateTime Pattern ➞ 2023-03-29T18:40:22"
ss,,The second. Single-digit seconds have a leading zero. ➞ 22
t,%t,"The first character in the AM/PM designator, if any. ➞ P. If this format pattern is not combined with other format patterns, just ""t"" alone, then the application will apply the standard ShortTime Pattern ➞ 18:40"
tt,,"The AM/PM designator (""ante meridiem"" (before noon) or ""post meridiem"" (after noon)), if any. Your application should use this format pattern for languages for which it is necessary to maintain the distinction between AM and PM. An example is Japanese, for which the AM and PM designators differ in the second character instead of the first character."
y,%y,"The year without the century. If the year without the century is less than 10, the year is displayed with no leading zero. ➞ 23. If this format pattern is not combined with other format patterns, just ""y"" alone, then the application will apply the standard YearMonth pattern ➞ March 2023 (which will vary by culture/locale)"
yy,,"The year without the century. If the year without the century is less than 10, the year is displayed with a leading zero."
yyy,,"The year in three digits. If the year is less than 100, the year is displayed with a leading zero."

Users selecting the ""yyyy"" pattern see all five digits without leading zeros for calendars that have five digits. Exception: the Japanese and Taiwan calendars always behave as if ""yy"" is selected."
yyyyy,,"The year in five digits. Pads with leading zeros to get five digits. Exception: the Japanese and Taiwan calendars always behave as if ""yy"" is selected."
yyyyyy,,"The year in six digits. Pads with leading zeros to get six digits. Exception: the Japanese and Taiwan calendars always behave as if ""yy"" is selected. The pattern can be continued with a longer string of ""y""s padding with more leading zeros."
z,%z,"The time zone offset (""+"" or ""-"" followed by the hour only). Single-digit hours do not have a leading zero. For example, Pacific Standard Time is ""-8"".. If this format pattern is not combined with other format patterns, just ""z"" alone, then the application will throw an error."
